On May 2 at 0:51 UTC, an anonymous user from Argentina added an entry to the English version of the Nyaa Torrents Wikipedia page: "In 2017, the site was closed due to the risk of being subject to severe fines under European Union law."

After 46 minutes, this entry was deleted. At 4 hours 33 minutes UTC, another version appeared: "On May 1, 2017 .se domain [site] was deactivated by the registrar." This variant with modifications existed for several days.

Torrent Freak: Anime Torrent Site Nyaa Down After Deactivating His Domain Name
*********

The popular anime torrent site Nyaa has lost control of several of its domain names, which were deactivated a few hours ago. As a result, the site became unavailable. The status of the domain suggests that there was registrar intervention, but it is also possible that the site owner himself made such a radical decision.

Nyaa is considered one of the main sources for anime, with an audience of millions of loyal users.

The site has been functioning for many years without any major problems. However, a few hours ago, it suddenly became unavailable due to an alarming domain name situation.

The status of the nyaa.se domain was changed to the nasty "serverhold", which implies direct intervention of the registrar. This status appeared in the past when domain names were put into special mode due to copyright issues and their DNS records were deleted.

HorribleSubs Team Leader Message
*********

While we haven't heard anything from NyaaTorrents, I think we can say with 90% 100% certainty that the site is completely dead, given that its Internet domains are scheduled to be removed. To be honest, I'm really sad. We started our activity around the same time and saw how the site grows. The last time I spoke to its owner a few months ago, he said that we should reach a billion downloads in the very near future. I guess now we will never know about it. ðŸ˜¦

Some quite qualified people contacted me and informed me that they were going to launch a full analogue of NyaaTorrents. We are waiting for this to happen, hopefully soon. We don't think there is any other fairly reputable anime-focused public tracker out there right now, so we'll postpone using one of them.

F-word, I'm really sad.

NyaaTorrents has stopped working: Post from the Nyaa Torrents Moderator Team
*********

May 03, 2017

On May 1, 2017, NyaaTorrents officially ceased all its operations. At this point, nothing is left of the site. These were direct actions of the owner of the site, and not the result of any internal problems or direct coercion by government or judicial authorities.

The specific reasons for the closure of the site are not known to anyone other than its anonymous owner. Taking into account the circumstances surrounding the closure of the site, people previously involved in its operation came to the conclusion that this was the result of recent decisions of the judiciary that could affect the functioning of the site.

Rather than face such a possibility in the future and with the consequences for all other participants in the site's activities, its owner decided to completely cease operations. Given the basics of its operation, the site will be completely destroyed and all of its contents, including system utilities, user interface and all databases, will most likely be cleaned up.

There are no plans to continue to be active under the NyaaTorrents logo. Any newly created projects have nothing to do with the site.

The above should be taken as an official statement of those who were previously related to the site. Additional questions can be addressed to them via the #NyaaTorrents IRC at irc.rizon.net.

Nyaa Pantsu: Official Nyaa Apocalypse FAQ
*********

What happened?

nyaa.se and associated domains (such as nyaatorrents.info) became unavailable on May 1, 2017.
The domains were deactivated, which means it was not a DDoS attack, as usual.
Nyaa's prospects for the future do not look bright. (He is dead.)
An attempt to bring the site back to life is taking place.
Is everything lost?

In short, no.

Is there something missing?

We have a Nyaa torrent database for 5 April 1 May. This means that almost nothing is lost.

Sukebei, however, may be in worse shape. At the moment we only have a database for 2016, but a newer one may still show up.

How do we recover?

The aforementioned bases are involved in the new project. There is search capability and (almost) full Nyaa functionality is expected soon. Seeder / lecher statistics are available through scraping and can be retrieved sometime in the future, since other tasks are now of higher priority.

Are torrents still working?

Even if the trackers do not work, the seeders remain connected to the decentralized DHT network. As long as the file is present on the DHT network, everything should function as usual.
